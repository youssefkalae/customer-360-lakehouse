# customer-360-lakehouse
Building an end-to-end Databricks + Postgres Customer 360 analytics platform that ingests raw usage, billing, and marketing data, models it through Bronze/Silver/Gold layers, and produces business metrics like MRR and churn for dashboards and downstream apps

# still looking forward to:
Add dbt for declarative transformations
Add mlflow for churn prediction modeling
Deploy dashboard to Streamlit Cloud (need to do more)
Sync Gold layer to Postgres for BI tools
Add better expectations for data quality checks
